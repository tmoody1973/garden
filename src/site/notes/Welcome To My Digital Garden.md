> A continuously evolving network of ideas, projects, and reflections.

This digital garden is where I gather, refine, and interconnect my thoughts across various fields. Rather than presenting completed articles, I treat each note as a living resource that grows over time. Feel free to explore the major topics listed below. Each category branches off into subnotes, resource collections, and reflections, making the garden a dynamic space for discovery.

## **How to Navigate**

- **Maps of Content (MOCs)**: Each area above has a dedicated MOC, providing a structured entry point into related subtopics and resource hubs.
- **Bidirectional Links**: Whenever you see `[[Brackets]]`, click them to jump to a related note. Follow backlinks on each page to discover connections you might not expect.
- **Tags and Searches**: Look for tags like `#resource`, `#reference`, or domain-specific tags (e.g., `#ai`) to filter or locate notes quickly.

## **Why a Digital Garden?**

Traditional blogs often present ideas in a linear, finalized format. A digital garden, however, allows notes to grow organically. As my interests shift or I uncover new resources, I can prune outdated information or branch out into fresh directions. This adaptive approach encourages continuous learning and invites collaboration by maintaining a transparent record of evolving thoughts.

## **Future Plans**

- **Regular Updates**: I revisit older notes to expand or refine them, weaving new insights into existing threads.
- **Resource Hubs**: Each topic features a central resource list for quick reference, capturing useful links, tools, and tutorials.
- **Community Feedback**: Although this garden primarily serves as my personal knowledge hub, I value shared ideas. Your perspective may help me cultivate more nuanced discussions or highlight avenues I have overlooked.
