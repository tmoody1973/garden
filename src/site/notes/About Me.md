# My Story

I was born in Louisville, Kentucky in July 1973 and spent my early years in Atlanta. My journey began at Howard University, where I earned my degree from the School of Architecture in 1996 on a 4-year Army ROTC scholarship. I went on to serve 14 years in the Army Reserves while starting my career as an architect in Detroit and Minneapolis.

## My Path to Radio

My life took an unexpected turn when I started volunteering at KFAI community radio in Minneapolis, co-hosting "Groove Garden." That experience sparked a passion that led me to 88Nine Radio Milwaukee in 2006. Now, I serve as Director of Digital and Program Director for HYFIN. One of my proudest achievements is Rhythm Lab Radio, which I launched in 2005. As we approach its 20th anniversary in 2025, it's grown into a nationally syndicated program that continues to push musical boundaries.

## My Tech Ventures

In 2018, I founded 88Nine Labs to transform Milwaukee's tech landscape. We've hosted incredible events, including talks with innovators like Jasmine Crowe from Goodr and Keisha Howard of Sugar Gamers. I'm particularly excited about our partnership with Super Hi-Fi, which has allowed us to create a 24/7 AI-driven online version of Rhythm Lab Radio.

## My Creative Projects

The Unlooped series holds a special place in my heart. We've created unique musical experiences like "Unlooped vs. Dilla" in 2011 and "Unlooped vs. Marvin Gaye" in 2014. One of my most significant achievements was launching HYFIN on Juneteenth 2022, where we celebrate Black music and culture across genres - from jazz and hip-hop to house, electronic, soul, Afrobeats, and Amapiano.

## My Personal Interests

Beyond my work in media and technology, I'm a certified sake professional and co-host Milwaukee's longest-running culinary podcast, "This Bites." I'm currently working on launching my clothing brand "bloom" in 2024, and I host the "Diverse Disruptors" podcast, where I explore innovation and inclusion in technology and entrepreneurship.

## My Digital Garden

This website serves as my digital garden, where I share my thoughts and experiences across various interests:
- AI and coding developments
- Gaming culture and technology
- Culinary arts and sake expertise
- Entrepreneurship insights
- Design and architectural perspectives
- Music supervision in media

I've created this digital space not just as a personal archive, but as a platform for building community and sharing knowledge in technology, music, and culture. It's a living document of my journey and a space where I can connect with others who share these passions.
